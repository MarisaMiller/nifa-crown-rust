In this directory are results for blasting the top 3 candidate effectors to the Pgt and Pst genomes. Pst protein fasta files were obtained from https://github.com/BenjaminSchwessinger/Pst_104_E137_A-_genome/tree/master/Secretomes, and the same version of proteins were used as were used for Secretome clustering at https://github.com/BenjaminSchwessinger/Pst_104_E137_A-_genome/tree/master/gene_expression. Pgt proteins were obtained from Table S7 in the recent AvrSr50 paper in Science: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6370/1607. I pulled out the sequences from the files and made them into a fasta file for blasting.
