In this directory are scripts and results to perform analysis of genome-wide coverage.

The logic behind this analysis is to divide the 12SD80 reference genome into bins, and then test how many of those bins have very low coverage. These could be regions of the genome that are missing in other isolates, and could represent presence/absence variation (PAV).
