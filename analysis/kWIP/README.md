In this directory are the files and scripts for kWIP analysis.

The files that would be in the hashes and reads directories (see the kwip.sh script) were not uploaded due to space limitations, but can be re-generated with the raw data (in ../raw_data directory) and the kwip.sh script.

The img_mod_from_original.R script is for plotting the results, and the name is derived from the original plotting script that was provided with kWIP (which I then modified).
