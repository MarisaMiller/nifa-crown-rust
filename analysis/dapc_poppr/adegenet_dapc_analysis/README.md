This is for data analysis with adegenet using the information at http://grunwaldlab.github.io/Population_Genetics_in_R/analysis_of_genome.html and also in the adegenet tutorials here (https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/wiki/Tutorials).

This is a very interactive analysis, please read script comments carefully.

Rdata files were not added due to size, but can be regenerated by following the whole analysis workflow.
