60 isolates of *Puccinia coronata* f. sp. *avenae* were re-sequenced using paired-end sequencing (100bp PE). This sequencing was done by the UMGC sequencing core (100 ng of DNA used for TruSeq Nano DNA procedure and a 350 bp insert size). 2 batches of 30 libraries were multiplexed and sequenced in 3.5 lanes (HiSeq 2500, High Output Mode, 125 bp paired-end reads) at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center (UMGC) (MN, USA) and I received the data on 2017-03-07, 2017-10-24, and 2017-11-17. Each isolate should have two sequence files, with R1 and R2 in the name, indicating which member of the pair it is.

The rename.py script in the scripts directory was used to rename the files.

In this directory would be the raw sequencing data (not uploaded here due to size limitations). All raw sequencing data can be obtained from NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/398546.

Also included are a list of samples names and the job submission script for QC and mapping of this data.
