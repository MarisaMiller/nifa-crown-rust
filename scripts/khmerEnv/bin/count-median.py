"""
Count the median/avg k-mer abundance for each sequence in the input file.

The abundance is based on the k-mer counts in the given k-mer countgraph.
Can be used to estimate expression levels (mRNAseq) or coverage
(genomic/metagenomic).

% scripts/count-median.py <countgraph> <input seqs> <output counts>

Use '-h' for parameter help.

The output file contains sequence id, median, average, stddev, and seq length.

NOTE: All 'N's in the input sequences are converted to 'A's.
